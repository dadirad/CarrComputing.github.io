<h3 style="text-align: center">Iceland</h3>

<p><i><b>Iceland</b></i> is a country of sharp contrasts. A place where fire and ice coexist. Where dark winters are offset by the summer's midnight sun. A country where insular existence has spurred a rich and vibrant culture.</p>

        <div class="sub sub2"><img src="#" alt=""><p>The Aurora Borealis takes its name from the Roman goddess of dawn, Aurora,
        and the Greek name for the north wind, Boreas. From September to
        April, Iceland is a hotspot for this magnificent lightshow.<br>

        The Aurora Borealis, more commonly referred to as the Northern Lights is a
        natural phenomenon created when particles emitted by the sun interact with
        the atmosphere in the Earth's magnetic field. This releases energy causing
        luminous green streaks across the skies.</p>
      </div>

        <div class="sub sub3"><img src="#" alt=""><p>When making a trip to Iceland, it is hard not to pay special attention to the country's namesake--namely, its 4,500 square miles of glacier. Ice climbing on the glaciers is practiced year-round and takes place mainly on Sólheimajökull and Svínafellsjökull glaciers in the south of Iceland, to which day trips are offered from Reykjavik (and Skaftafell).</p>

The film's two leading actors, John Hawkes and Logan Lerman, are also praised in both reviews. Hawkes has quite a few films under his belt and was nominated for an Oscar for Winter's Bones and young Lerman is best known for his role in The Perks of Being a Wallflower. Icelandic actor Olafur Darri Olafsson also has a small part in End of Sentence.
